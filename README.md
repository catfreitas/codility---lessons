# Codility Lessons - PHP

Codility Lessons is a section where you can train your programming skills. This class has 17 themes and each one has several challenges in which the difficulty can vary between easy, medium and difficult.

In this repository you will find some solutions that I developed in PHP from codility lessons.

*Attention: There is a solution that despite being 100% correct, does not have 100% performance.
